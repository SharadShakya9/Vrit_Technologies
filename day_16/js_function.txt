JS model:
    -Declaration phase & Execution phase
    -Single thread, yet performs asynchronous actions

Microtask queue (Priority queue):
    -Promise functions

Call Stack:
    -Normal functions
    -Filled by nested functions
    -Callback Hell: Long nested functions fill to the limit of the call stack

Lexical Environment:
    -A function wrapped together with its sibling properties
    -Use case: React function composition, Writing test case

Function is a first class region; takes input and gives output

Event Loops:
    -Located between queue and call stack
    -Continuously listens queue, if there is a function in queue, the event loop puts the function in the call stack
    -Helps in asynchronous programming

Higher Order Function:
    -The function that takes a function as parameter and returns function as well
